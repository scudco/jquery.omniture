You can run the tests by opening spec/javascripts/fixtures/jquery.omniture.html

I would really like to know how this plugin can be improved. I feel bad about 
the overkill of including all of BlueRidge and would also like to figure out a 
way to make an actual omniture prototype instead of just a single method. 

halp plz?
